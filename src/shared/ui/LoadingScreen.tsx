/**
 * The loading screen, and the only place the bear is ever seen whole.
 *
 * Android 12+ masks the native splash icon to a 192dp circle and offers no way
 * to opt out (see `src/shared/splash.test.ts`), so the native splash can only
 * ever show a small, static, circle-cropped bear. This takes over the instant
 * that splash hides, on the same `#8AE3F5` sky, so the two read as one screen —
 * the bear appears to grow out of the circle rather than being replaced.
 *
 * Everything here is Reanimated, which the app already ships and which runs the
 * animation on the UI thread — so the dots keep pulsing smoothly while the
 * JS thread is busy opening the database and mounting the navigator behind this
 * overlay. That is the whole reason to animate a loading screen: it stays alive
 * exactly when the JS thread cannot.
 *
 * Rive and Lottie were both considered. Rive needs a native module, so it cannot
 * reach the device without a fresh 15-minute build, and it needs a `.riv` file
 * the team has not authored. Lottie *is* installed (see `AnimatedArt`) but has no
 * animation files either. Reanimated over the existing PNG needs neither, so this
 * ships today; `AnimatedArt` stays the seam for real Lottie art later.
