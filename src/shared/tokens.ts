 * that window cannot be removed, only dressed. So there will always be two
 * things on screen in sequence, and the only question is whether the seam shows.
 *
 * It did. The native splash drew the bear at `imageWidth` while `LoadingScreen`
 * drew it at `min(width * 0.52, 240)` — equal only on a 360dp-wide phone, which
 * is the width the test happened to check. On the 393–412dp phones most people
 * actually hold, the bear jumped 16–22% larger at the handoff, and a wordmark,
 * three dots and a caption appeared around it at the same instant. Two screens.
 *
 * These numbers are the contract that stops that: `LoadingScreen` opens with its
 * bear at exactly `iconWidth` on exactly `background`, so its first frame is
 * indistinguishable from the native window's last one, and *then* animates. The
 * native splash becomes the first frame of the loading screen rather than a
 * different screen shown before it. `src/shared/splash.test.ts` pins both values
 * against `app.json`, which cannot import from here.
