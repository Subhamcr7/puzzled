 * Board SFX + ambient music, built on expo-audio's player API
 * (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/sdk/audio/ — `createAudioPlayer`,
 * `player.play()`/`.seekTo()`/`.remove()`; expo-audio replaced expo-av in
 * SDK 54+ and has a different player-object API).
 *
 * Players are module-level singletons created once per app process and
 * reused across every board mount/restart — `initBoardAudio` is safe to call
 * repeatedly. Every exported call here is fire-and-forget and must never
 * throw: a failed play must not interrupt a drag.
